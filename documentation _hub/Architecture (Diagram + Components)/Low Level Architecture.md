# Low Level Architecture

Great! Now that your documentation is ready and well-structured, the best way to start developing your Autonomous AI Newsletter & Services Pipeline project is to begin **with the foundational setup and core components** that will make the rest easier and more manageable.

Here’s a clear **step-by-step practical starting guide** to get you going smoothly:

---

### Step 1: Set Up Your Project Management and Planning Environment

- **Create your Notion workspace** for the project as described in the documentation (Step 6).
- Set up the databases (Tasks, Articles Staging, Prompt Library) and Kanban boards for managing tasks and progress.
- This gives you a clear, centralized hub to track everything from code tasks to prompt improvements.

---

### Step 2: Develop the Data Ingestion Module

- **Start coding the pipeline to fetch AI news data.**
- Pick 1-2 APIs or RSS feeds initially (e.g., NewsAPI, ArXiv RSS, Reddit AI subreddit) and write Python scripts to pull raw articles.
- Save these raw articles with metadata (title, source, date, URL) in a staging database (could be a simple local DB or Notion API integration).

*Why first?* Because this forms the raw data foundation your pipeline depends on.

---

### Step 3: Prototype Deduplication Logic

- Using the raw data, build a **basic embedding generation and similarity check** script.
- Use a simple embedding library like OpenAI embeddings or SentenceTransformers (whichever fits your budget).
- Implement a quick similarity check to identify duplicates in your sample dataset.
- Store embeddings in a lightweight vector store (like FAISS locally or Pinecone sandbox).

*This ensures that your data ingestion pipeline filters noise before moving on.*

### Step 4: Experiment with Summarization Prompts

- Use OpenAI or Anthropic APIs to **summarize a few unique articles manually** with different prompt templates stored in your Notion prompt library.
- Test quality and tweak prompts until you get concise, informative summaries.
- This will help later to automate the summarization step confidently.

---

### Step 5: Connect the Pipeline Components

- Combine ingestion, deduplication, and summarization scripts into a single workflow.
- Build simple orchestration logic with Python or use a no-code tool like n8n to trigger each step in sequence.
- Run end-to-end tests on a few weeks’ worth of articles.

---

### Step 6: Build Newsletter Assembly and Publishing

- Create the HTML template for your newsletter.
- Write the code to insert summarized content into the template dynamically.
- Use Substack or Mailchimp API to send test newsletters to your email.

---

### Step 7: Add Optional Human-in-the-Loop QA

- Create Notion forms or pages for editors to review generated summaries.
- Integrate this approval step into your pipeline before publishing.

---

### Step 8: Iterate, Monitor, and Expand

- Add monitoring, logging, and analytics for pipeline health and content performance.
- Optimize and automate social media snippet generation and posting.
- Start planning future AI services expansion.

### Summary: Where to start?

**Begin with Step 1 (Project Management in Notion), then Step 2 (Data Ingestion).** The raw data foundation is essential before moving forward.
