# Overview and Business Goals

The AI-powered newsletter platform will **automatically aggregate and curate AI-related news** (from sources like ArXiv, Twitter, Reddit) into a concise, weekly email for subscribers. Its goal is to **save time for readers** by delivering the latest, most relevant AI developments without manual effort. This addresses a real need: as one guide notes, *“major events often get covered by multiple outlets, resulting in a flood of similar articles,”* so readers can easily feel overwhelmed by redundant information[newscatcherapi.com](https://www.newscatcherapi.com/docs/v3/documentation/guides-and-concepts/articles-deduplication#:~:text=Ever%20feel%20like%20you%E2%80%99re%20seeing,to%20find%20unique%2C%20valuable%20content). By filtering out duplicates (via semantic similarity) and summarizing key points, the platform ensures subscribers get **diverse, unique news insights** in one place.

Business goals include building a growing subscriber base, increasing engagement, and potentially monetizing the newsletter through sponsorships or premium content. Automating content curation also enables **scalability** – marketing teams and publishers can produce high-volume newsletters efficiently. In fact, AI newsletter tools are already used in industry: for example, a case study describes an *“AI Newsletter Agent”* that collects content from multiple platforms and generates a “well-structured newsletter” with summaries[apify.com](https://apify.com/louisdeconinck/ai-newsletter-agent#:~:text=1,highlighting%20key%20trends%20and%20insights). And AI-driven aggregators are a recognized use case: a recent review of AI newsletter tools highlights **“content aggregators [who] curate industry-specific news digests by automatically compiling relevant articles from multiple sources”**[aicovery.com](https://www.aicovery.com/tools/redense-ai#:~:text=Use%20Cases). Our platform will follow this pattern but with custom focus on AI research/news and using GPT-4.5 for summarization.

Key business objectives:

- Deliver timely, accurate AI news summaries weekly.
- Grow a subscriber list (free or paid) and maintain high engagement (open/click rates).
- Position the brand as an AI thought-leader by leveraging cutting-edge automation.
