# Recommended Technology Stack

**Data Ingestion:**

- **ArXiv:** Use the official ArXiv API (returns Atom/XML). There are libraries (e.g. arxiv Python package) and documentation[info.arxiv.org](https://info.arxiv.org/help/api/basics.html#:~:text=The%20goal%20of%20the%20API,contact%20other%20developers%20and%20maintainers).
- **Twitter/X:** Use the X API v2 (with Tweepy or Twarc libraries) or web scraping if API restrictions are tight.
- **Reddit:** Use Reddit’s API via PRAW or Reddit’s RSS feeds for specific subreddits.
- **RSS/News Feeds:** For any additional news sites, use Python’s `feedparser` to read RSS.

**Backend & Orchestration:**

- **Language:** Python is a strong choice (rich NLP libraries, easy API calls). Node.js or Go could also work.
- **Web Framework:** If we need a lightweight API (e.g. to serve subscriber data), Flask or FastAPI (Python) or Express (Node) are good.
- **Task Queue:** Celery (with RabbitMQ/Redis) or managed queues like AWS SQS/Kinesis to coordinate jobs. This enables asynchronous processing (dedupe, summarize).
- **Database:** PostgreSQL or MongoDB (or DynamoDB) to store articles, summaries, and subscriber data. A vector database (e.g. Pinecone, Weaviate) or Redis could store embeddings for fast similarity queries.
- **Storage:** Object storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) for large or raw files.

**Duplicate Filtering:**

- **Embeddings:** Use sentence-transformers (e.g. `sentence-transformers` Python library) or an embedding API (OpenAI’s embedding endpoints) to vectorize text.
- **Cosine Similarity:** Compute similarities (NumPy, FAISS, or Pinecone) and remove near-duplicates. For example, if similarity > 0.95, drop one[newscatcherapi.com](https://www.newscatcherapi.com/docs/v3/documentation/guides-and-concepts/articles-deduplication#:~:text=1,95%20to%20identify%20potential%20duplicates).
- **Libraries:** The `semhash` tool (GitHub) or other dedup packages could be integrated if needed.

**AI Summarization:**

- **Model:** The easiest path is using OpenAI’s GPT-4 via API (or another LLM like Claude or an open-source model fine-tuned for summarization). Hugging Face Transformers also provide summarization models (e.g. `t5-small`, `facebook/bart-large-cnn`). For example, the Transformers library has a `pipeline("summarization")` utility for quick setup[huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/tasks/summarization#:~:text=You%20can%20use%20the%20Transformers,6).
- **Example:**
    
    ```python
    python
    CopyEdit
    from transformers import pipeline
    summarizer = pipeline("summarization")
    summary = summarizer(article_text, max_length=100)[0]['summary_text']
    
    ```
    
- **Costs:** Using GPT-4 (or GPT-4.5) costs money: e.g. GPT-4.1 charges around *$10 per 1M input tokens and $40 per 1M output tokens*[openai.com](https://openai.com/api/pricing/#:~:text=Input%3A%20%2410). We must budget for that. Using smaller open models (e.g. `distilbart-cnn-12-6`) can reduce cost, at some quality trade-off.

**Newsletter Assembly & Email:**

- **Templating:** Use a simple HTML templating library (e.g. Jinja2 for Python, or Handlebars) to merge summaries into an email template.
- **Email Service:** Options include:
    - **Mailing Service API:** Send via Mailgun/SendGrid AWS SES (use API keys). Good for full automation and deliverability.
    - **Substack/Beehiiv:** If using Substack, note it lacks a publish API[simonwillison.net](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/4/substack-observable/#:~:text=Substack%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20yet%20offer%20an,public%20plans%20to%20do%20so), so you might generate the HTML and paste it into Substack’s editor (which can accept pasted HTML). Beehiiv has a more open API for sending content (and possibly RSS-to-newsletter features).
    - **SMTP:** You could also send directly via SMTP to a mailing list (e.g. via a corporate mail server) but a dedicated newsletter service is recommended for analytics.

**DevOps & Infrastructure:**

- **Containerization:** Dockerize services for consistency. Use Kubernetes/EKS or serverless platforms (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions) for deployment.
- **CI/CD:** Use GitHub Actions, GitLab CI or Jenkins to automate testing and deployment on commit[about.gitlab.com](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ci-cd/continuous-integration-best-practices/#:~:text=CI%20best%20practice%3A%20Commit%20early%2C,commit%20often).
- **Version Control:** Git (GitHub/GitLab) for code and configuration.
- **Monitoring:** Use cloud monitoring (CloudWatch, Prometheus) and logging (Elasticsearch/Kibana or a managed log service) to track errors, queue backlogs, and email metrics.

**Tools:**

- **Project Management:** Jira or GitHub Projects for Agile tracking.
- **Testing:** pytest or Jest for unit tests, Postman for API tests.
- **Documentation:** Swagger/OpenAPI for any APIs; README for setup.
