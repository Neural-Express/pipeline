# Timeline and Resources

A **rough timeline** (assuming a small team of ~2–3 developers, 1 project manager/QA) might be:

- **Month 1 (Weeks 1–4):** Project kickoff, requirements, architecture design. Prototype ArXiv fetch and storage. Set up development environments, version control, and basic CI pipeline.
- **Month 2 (Weeks 5–8):** Build additional fetchers (Twitter, Reddit). Implement the deduplication service and store unique items. Begin simple frontend or dashboard (if needed) to view stored articles.
- **Month 3 (Weeks 9–12):** Integrate summarization: connect the pipeline to GPT-4.5 API. Iterate on prompts and store summaries. Develop the newsletter template and test HTML assembly.
- **Month 4 (Weeks 13–16):** Build the email sending mechanism. Run internal tests: generate a weekly newsletter from collected data. Continue improving dedup logic and summary quality based on feedback.
- **Month 5 (Weeks 17–20):** Thorough testing and QA (unit/integration tests, load tests). Set up monitoring/alerts. Prepare pilot launch (beta subscribers). Collect feedback and fix issues.
- **Month 6 (Weeks 21–24):** Launch to production. Monitor system and newsletter metrics. Plan next features or iterations (e.g. UI for newsletter editing, analytics).

According to industry benchmarks, an MVP with advanced features (like ML integration) typically takes **3–6 months** to develop[cyces.co](https://cyces.co/blog/mvp-ideal-timeline#:~:text=Three%20to%20six%20months%3A), so this schedule aligns with best practices.

**Resources:**

- **Team:** 2–3 software developers (full-stack/NLP mix), 1 AI/NLP specialist (could be same person as dev), 1 QA/DevOps engineer, 1 project manager. Smaller teams could extend the timeline accordingly.
- **Tools/Subscriptions:** Paid accounts for necessary APIs (Twitter, OpenAI). Example: OpenAI GPT-4 usage might run a few hundred dollars per month depending on volume; plan for ~$1,000–2,000 initial budget and adjust after measurement. Cloud hosting (e.g. AWS) might be <$100/month at MVP scale (using free tiers or low-tier instances).
- **Cost Estimate:** Roughly, labor is the largest cost. If developers’ fully-loaded cost is ~$10k–$15k per month, a 3-person team for 6 months is on the order of $180k–$270k in labor. Plus say $5–10k total for API and hosting. These are very approximate figures and will vary by region and hourly rates.

In summary, expect **3–6 months** of development time for an MVP with current technologies[cyces.co](https://cyces.co/blog/mvp-ideal-timeline#:~:text=Three%20to%20six%20months%3A). Ongoing costs after launch (team maintenance, API usage, hosting) are moderate but should be planned (e.g. budgeting for LLM costs like GPT usage[openai.com](https://openai.com/api/pricing/#:~:text=Input%3A%20%2410)). Using open-source components where possible (like Hugging Face models) can reduce API fees, but may require more development effort.

**Final Note:** This plan combines industry best practices (modular cloud architecture, CI/CD, Agile development) with specific solutions for news aggregation and summarization[newscatcherapi.com](https://www.newscatcherapi.com/docs/v3/documentation/guides-and-concepts/articles-deduplication#:~:text=1,95%20to%20identify%20potential%20duplicates)[github.com](https://github.com/aws-samples/news-clustering-and-summarization#:~:text=This%20solution%20leverages%20a%20combination,Groups%2C%20S3%2C%20and%20Amazon%20Bedrock)[creately.com](https://creately.com/blog/project-management/what-is-scrum-methodology-scrum-process/#:~:text=Scrum%20is%20an%20agile%20project,4%20week%20sprints). By following a structured methodology and allowing for iterative improvements, the team can deliver a scalable, production-quality newsletter platform that remains accessible to beginners (through clear design and documentation) yet is robust enough for real-world use.
