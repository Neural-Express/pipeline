# Deployment and Maintenance Strategy

**Deployment:** We recommend deploying on a cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP) for scalability and managed services. For example, on AWS we could use:

- AWS Lambda for lightweight services (ingestion, summarization calls)
- AWS SQS or SNS for queues
- AWS EC2 (or ECS/EKS) for any long-running or heavy-duty tasks (like batch deduplication)
- AWS S3 for storage, DynamoDB or RDS for the database
- Amazon SES or an SMTP relay for email.

Alternatively, a container-based approach on Kubernetes (e.g. GKE or EKS) is also solid: each service runs in its own container and K8s handles scaling. Docker Compose can be used for initial local deployment/testing.

We will set up **CI/CD pipelines** to automate releases: for instance, on each commit to `main`, run tests, then deploy containers to the cloud. Tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation can script the infrastructure setup (networks, queues, databases).

**Security:** API keys (ArXiv, Twitter, OpenAI) will be stored securely (e.g. AWS Secrets Manager or environment variables in CI/CD). Use HTTPS for any web hooks or APIs. Ensure least-privilege IAM roles for cloud components.

**Monitoring:** Use a monitoring service (e.g. CloudWatch + Grafana) to track metrics like: number of articles fetched, queue lengths, summarization latency, email send rate, error rates. Alerts will notify the team if, say, no newsletters were assembled this week or an API quota is exceeded.

**Maintenance:**

- **Content Sources:** Periodically review if fetchers need updates (e.g. if Reddit changes API, or ArXiv adds categories).
- **Models:** Monitor model costs and performance. If GPT-4.5 is too costly, plan a switch to a cheaper model or batch requests (OpenAI Batch API)[openai.com](https://openai.com/api/pricing/#:~:text=Input%3A%20%2410). We may also retrain or fine-tune summarization models in the future.
- **Newsletter Content:** Occasionally audit the content manually to ensure the AI isnâ€™t injecting biases or errors. Update prompt instructions as needed.
- **Subscriber Management:** Keep subscriber lists clean (remove bounces/unsubs). Monitor deliverability (avoid spam filters).
- **Costs:** Track cloud and API spending. Set usage alerts (e.g. for OpenAI spend) to prevent surprises.

In production, we should design for **zero-downtime updates** (e.g. deploy new container versions behind a load balancer). Rollback plans are important: if a new change breaks the workflow, we can revert to the last stable version quickly.
