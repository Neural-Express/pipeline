# Design and Development Strategy

Our design strategy emphasizes **modularity, simplicity, and scalability**. We will use proven design patterns:

- **Microservices or Modular Services:** Each major function (fetching from ArXiv, deduplicating, summarizing) is developed as an independent module or service. This way, teams can develop/test in parallel, and we can use the best tool/language for each part. For example, a Python service for summarization and a Node.js service for sending emails are each separately deployable.
- **Containerization:** Use Docker to package services with all dependencies. This ensures “works on my machine” portability and simplifies deployment to servers or cloud containers.
- **API-First Design:** Define clear APIs or message schemas between components early. For instance, the fetcher might publish JSON messages `{source, title, content, url}` to a queue. Other services must agree on that schema. Good API design (possibly using Swagger/OpenAPI) will make integration smoother.
- **Scalable Data Storage:** Design the database schema to easily add new fields (e.g. sentiment, categories). Consider using a vector database for embeddings to speed up deduplication queries.
- **AI Prompts and Quality:** We should prototype and tune the GPT-4.5 prompts for summarization carefully. This is part of “design”: before coding, experiment with a few article summaries to decide on prompt templates. For instance, “Summarize this paper in two sentences focusing on key findings.” Save these templates for later automation.
- **Feature Flagging:** During development, use feature flags or config switches. For example, start with summarization turned off (just collect articles) and then enable it once stable. Feature flags let us test each piece in isolation.
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Every code commit triggers automated tests and builds, so we maintain code quality[about.gitlab.com](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ci-cd/continuous-integration-best-practices/#:~:text=CI%20best%20practice%3A%20Commit%20early%2C,commit%20often). We’ll include linting (flake8/ESLint), unit tests, and if possible integration tests (e.g. mocking an ArXiv fetch).
- **Incremental Delivery:** Rather than building all at once, we deliver in steps. For example, Milestone 1: ArXiv fetch + dedupe + store raw. Milestone 2: Twitter/Reddit fetch added. Milestone 3: Summarization integrated. Milestone 4: Newsletter formatting and send. Each milestone should be a working piece.

Throughout development, we will **document** architecture decisions and APIs. Using a shared knowledge base (e.g. Confluence, Notion) ensures that new team members can quickly onboard. We will also write up the data model and any data flows as we go.

# Testing and Quality Assurance

Ensuring correctness and reliability is critical, especially since the output is content sent to users. Our testing strategy includes:

- **Unit Tests:** Write automated tests for small components (e.g. test the deduplication logic with sample texts, test the summarizer service returns expected format). This is standard practice to catch regressions.
- **Integration Tests:** Set up test pipelines on dummy data. For example, a test that runs a few fake “articles” through the full pipeline (fetch → dedupe → summarize → assemble) and checks end-to-end behavior.
- **Mocking External Services:** For components that call external APIs (ArXiv, Twitter, OpenAI), use mocking or staging accounts in tests to simulate responses. This avoids unnecessary API costs during testing.
- **AI Quality Checks:** For summarization, implement a review process: initially, manually inspect a sample of AI-generated summaries each week to ensure they are accurate and non-biased. We might create a small validation set of known articles to regularly check summary quality. Automating this fully is hard, but we could use metrics (ROUGE, BLEU) as rough guides if we have reference summaries (not always available for news).
- **Duplicate Detection Validation:** Randomly sample articles and check dedup logic. For instance, ensure the system isn’t erroneously flagging distinct items as duplicates. We can log duplicates detected and review a sample.
- **Email Testing:** Before sending real emails, use test subscribers and check for formatting issues. Tools like Mailgun provide “email previews” and spam-score checks. We’ll also verify unsubscribe links and compliance (GDPR/CAN-SPAM).
- **Load/Performance Testing:** Simulate high-volume ingestion to ensure the system scales. For example, generate a burst of 100 ArXiv items and see how the queue and processors handle it.
- **Automated Regression (CI):** Set up CI pipelines (GitHub Actions/Jenkins) so that any commit triggers tests and only merges if tests pass[about.gitlab.com](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ci-cd/continuous-integration-best-practices/#:~:text=CI%20best%20practice%3A%20Commit%20early%2C,commit%20often). This maintains code quality over time.
- **Code Reviews:** Use peer code reviews for all significant changes. This is a qualitative quality check.

Overall, following best practices like frequent commits and automated tests improves quality[about.gitlab.com](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ci-cd/continuous-integration-best-practices/#:~:text=CI%20best%20practice%3A%20Commit%20early%2C,commit%20often). We will also log errors and set up alerts (e.g. if summarization API returns an error) to catch issues in production quickly.
