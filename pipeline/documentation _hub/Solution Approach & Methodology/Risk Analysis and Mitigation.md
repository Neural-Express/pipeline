# Risk Analysis and Mitigation

Risks and mitigations include:

- **Data Source Changes:** External APIs (Twitter/X, Reddit, ArXiv) may change or rate-limit us. *Mitigation:* Use official APIs where possible and stay informed of policy changes. Implement caching and rate limiting, and have fallback sources (e.g. if Twitter fails, rely more on Reddit or RSS).
- **Duplicate/Irrelevant Content:** The deduplication might not catch all redundancies, or might over-filter. *Mitigation:* Use proven methods (embedding+threshold[newscatcherapi.com](https://www.newscatcherapi.com/docs/v3/documentation/guides-and-concepts/articles-deduplication#:~:text=1,95%20to%20identify%20potential%20duplicates)) and manually tune thresholds. Allow an editor override in extreme cases.
- **Summarization Errors (Hallucinations):** GPT can sometimes produce incorrect info. *Mitigation:* Limit summary length and encourage conservative phrasing (“According to the paper…”). We could append the source link so readers can fact-check. In early stages, have a human spot-check summaries.
- **Email Deliverability:** Automated newsletters risk landing in spam. *Mitigation:* Use verified sending domains, include unsubscribe links (required by law), and monitor spam scores. Start with smaller subscriber counts and ramp up gradually.
- **Performance/Scalability:** If content volume spikes (e.g. a major AI breakthrough releases dozens of papers), systems may lag. *Mitigation:* Architect for horizontal scaling (e.g. auto-scale compute for embedding and summarization). Use queues to buffer.
- **Cost Overruns:** Heavy API use (LLM calls) can be expensive. *Mitigation:* Budget carefully, use smaller models when possible, and optimize text length sent. Cache summaries of popular articles.
- **Regulatory/Legal:** Ensure we comply with content licenses (ArXiv is open-access, but Twitter/Reddit have terms). *Mitigation:* Respect `robots.txt` and API terms. Cite sources properly, and allow content authors to opt out if needed.
- **Project Management:** Requirements creep or unclear goals can derail progress. *Mitigation:* Use Agile (short sprints) to adjust priorities, and keep a lean scope for MVP[cyces.co](https://cyces.co/blog/mvp-ideal-timeline#:~:text=One%20to%20three%20months%3A).

Following risk-management best practices is important. As one guide notes, *“effective risk management involves identifying potential risks, prioritizing them based on severity, and developing a detailed risk mitigation plan”*[netguru.com](https://www.netguru.com/blog/strategies-for-software-risk-management#:~:text=analysis%2C%20planning%2C%20and%20monitoring,a%20detailed%20risk%20mitigation%20plan). We will maintain a risk register and review it each sprint.
