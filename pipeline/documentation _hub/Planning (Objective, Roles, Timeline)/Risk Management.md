## ✅ Risk Analysis & Mitigation

Every project faces potential risks that can delay timelines, increase costs, or reduce quality. Identifying these risks early and planning mitigations is critical for project success.

### Key Risks & Mitigation Strategies

| **Risk** | **Impact** | **Mitigation Plan** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **API Rate Limits** | Data ingestion delays or failures | Use batch requests; implement exponential backoff; rotate APIs/sources if possible. |
| **Duplicate Content Slip-through** | Subscribers receive repeated or stale news | Fine-tune embedding similarity thresholds; implement manual QA review for flagged duplicates. |
| **Notion API Limitations** | Workflow automation may slow down or fail | Cache frequent queries locally; optimize API calls; upgrade Notion plan if needed. |
| **LLM Usage Cost Overruns** | Unexpectedly high cloud costs | Optimize prompt length; batch multiple requests; monitor usage regularly with alerts. |
| **Newsletter Delivery Failures** | Subscribers don’t receive emails on time | Use reliable email providers (Substack, Mailchimp); implement retry logic and alerting. |
| **Data Privacy & Compliance** | Legal issues with data usage | Adhere to GDPR/CCPA guidelines; avoid scraping personal user data. |
| **Technology Changes** | APIs or tools used may change or deprecate | Modularize code for easy updates; monitor tool updates actively. |
| **Human QA Bottleneck** | Delays in review can hold up publishing | Keep QA optional; automate quality scoring; assign backup editors. |

### Risk Management Process

- **Regular Review:** Weekly project meetings to discuss emerging risks.
- **Monitoring:** Set up monitoring tools to detect anomalies early.
- **Fallback Plans:** Prepare alternative data sources and email providers.
- **Documentation:** Keep a risk register in Notion for tracking issues and resolutions.
