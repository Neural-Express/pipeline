    "title": "Effective Training Data Synthesis for Improving MLLM Chart Understanding",
    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06492v1",
    "content": "Being able to effectively read scientific plots, or chart understanding, is a\ncentral part toward building effective agents for science. However, existing\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially open-source ones, are\nstill falling behind with a typical success rate of 30%-50% on challenging\nbenchmarks. Previous studies on fine-tuning MLLMs with synthetic charts are\noften restricted by their inadequate similarity to the real charts, which could\ncompromise model training and performance on complex real-world charts. In this\nstudy, we show that modularizing chart generation and diversifying visual\ndetails improves chart understanding capabilities. In particular, we design a\nfive-step data synthesis pipeline, where we separate data and function creation\nfor single plot generation, condition the generation of later subplots on\nearlier ones for multi-subplot figures, visually diversify the generated\nfigures, filter out low quality data, and finally generate the question-answer\n(QA) pairs with GPT-4o. This approach allows us to streamline the generation of\nfine-tuning datasets and introduce the effective chart dataset (ECD), which\ncontains 10k+ chart images and 300k+ QA pairs, covering 25 topics and featuring\n250+ chart type combinations with high visual complexity. We show that ECD\nconsistently improves the performance of various MLLMs on a range of real-world\nand synthetic test sets.

    "title": "Computational Methods and Verification Theorem for Portfolio-Consumption Optimization under Exponential O-U Dynamics",
    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06491v1",
    "content": "In this paper, we focus on the problem of optimal portfolio-consumption\npolicies in a multi-asset financial market, where the n risky assets follow\nExponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, along with one risk-free bond. The\ninvestor's preferences are modeled using Constant Relative Risk Aversion\nutility with state-dependent stochastic discounting. The problem can be\nformulated as a high-dimensional stochastic optimal control problem, wherein\nthe associated value function satisfies a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB)\nequation, which constitutes a necessary condition for optimality. We apply a\nvariable separation technique to transform the HJB equation to a system of\nordinary differential equations (ODEs). Then a class of hybrid numerical\napproaches that integrate exponential Rosenbrock-type methods with Runge-Kutta\nmethods is proposed to solve the ODE system. More importantly, we establish a\nrigorous verification theorem that provides sufficient conditions for the\nexistence of value function and admissible optimal control, which can be\nverified numerically. A series of experiments are performed, demonstrating that\nour proposed method outperforms the conventional grid-based method in both\naccuracy and computational cost. Furthermore, the numerically derived optimal\npolicy achieves superior performance over all other considered admissible\npolicies.",

In this work, we first consider the existing parallel PoW protocols\nand develop hard-coded incentive attack structures. Our theoretical results and\nsimulations show that the existing parallel PoW protocols are more vulnerable\nto incentive attacks than the Nakamoto consensus, e.g., attacks have smaller\nprofitability threshold and they result in higher relative rewards. Next, we\nintroduce a voting-based semi-parallel PoW protocol that outperforms both\nNakamoto consensus and the existing parallel PoW protocols from most practical\nperspectives such as communication overheads, throughput, transaction\nconflicts, incentive compatibility of the protocol as well as a fair\ndistribution of transaction fees among the voters and the leaders. We use\nstate-of-the-art analysis to evaluate the consistency of the protocol and\nconsider Markov decision process (MDP) models to substantiate our claims about\nthe resilience of our protocol against incentive attacks.",

We present the algorithms in general setting such that they can be\nused to solve general linear parabolic partial differential equations with\nsecond-order sticky boundary condition via the probabilistic representations of\ntheir solutions.

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06486v1",
    "content": "We study the problem of computing a rank-$k$ approximation of a matrix using\nrandomized block Krylov iteration. Prior work has shown that, for block size $b\n= 1$ or $b = k$, a $(1 + \\varepsilon)$-factor approximation to the best\nrank-$k$ approximation can be obtained after $\\tilde O(k/\\sqrt{\\varepsilon})$\nmatrix-vector products with the target matrix. On the other hand, when $b$ is\nbetween $1$ and $k$, the best known bound on the number of matrix-vector\nproducts scales with $b(k-b)$, which could be as large as $O(k^2)$.\nNevertheless, in practice, the performance of block Krylov methods is often\noptimized by choosing a block size $1 \\ll b \\ll k$. We resolve this\ntheory-practice gap by proving that randomized block Krylov iteration produces\na $(1 + \\varepsilon)$-factor approximate rank-$k$ approximation using $\\tilde\nO(k/\\sqrt{\\varepsilon})$ matrix-vector products for any block size $1\\le b\\le\nk$. Our analysis relies on new bounds for the minimum singular value of a\nrandom block Krylov matrix, which may be of independent interest. Similar\nbounds are central to recent breakthroughs on faster algorithms for sparse\nlinear systems [Peng & Vempala, SODA 2021; Nie, STOC 2022].",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06485v1",
    "content": "Urbanization, climate change, and agricultural stress are increasing the\ndemand for precise and timely environmental monitoring. Land Surface\nTemperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from\nremote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between\nspatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer\npromising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m\nresolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a Weakly-Supervised Generative\nNetwork for Daily 10 m LST Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Terra\nMODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning\nframework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative\nadversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature\nextraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage\nemploys a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from\nthe inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity,\nnormalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the\nfused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to\nsuppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy\nbased on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN\ndiscriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods\nin both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the\nbest-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.18% and improves\nSSIM by 11.00%. Furthermore, WGAST is robust to cloud-induced LST and\neffectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against 33\nground-based sensors. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/Sofianebouaziz1/WGAST.git.",

We surveyed marketing and sales professionals to assess their\nability to critically evaluate LLM-generated analyses of marketing data.\nParticipants were shown natural language explanations of the AI's code,\nrepeatedly informed the AI often makes mistakes, and explicitly prompted to\nidentify them. Yet, participants frequently failed to detect critical flaws\nthat could compromise decision-making, many of which required no technical\nknowledge to recognize. To investigate why, we reformatted AI responses into\nclearly delineated steps and provided alternative approaches for each decision\nto support critical evaluation. While these changes had a positive effect,\nparticipants often struggled to reason through the AI's steps and alternatives.\nOur findings suggest that business professionals cannot reliably verify\nAI-generated data analyses on their own and explore reasons why to inform\nfuture designs. As non-programmers adopt code-generating AI for technical\ntasks, unreliable AI and insufficient human oversight poses risks of unsafe or\nlow-quality decisions.",

But their deployment in psychiatric\ncontexts raises a distinctive ethical concern: the problem of atypicality.\nBecause LLMs generate outputs based on population-level statistical\nregularities, their responses -- while typically appropriate for general users\n-- may be dangerously inappropriate when interpreted by psychiatric patients,\nwho often exhibit atypical cognitive or interpretive patterns. We argue that\nstandard mitigation strategies, such as prompt engineering or fine-tuning, are\ninsufficient to resolve this structural risk. Instead, we propose dynamic\ncontextual certification (DCC): a staged, reversible and context-sensitive\nframework for deploying LLMs in psychiatry, inspired by clinical translation\nand dynamic safety models from artificial intelligence governance. DCC reframes\nchatbot deployment as an ongoing epistemic and ethical process that prioritises\ninterpretive safety over static performance benchmarks. Atypicality, we argue,\ncannot be eliminated -- but it can, and must, be proactively managed.",
