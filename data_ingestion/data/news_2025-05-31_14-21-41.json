Despite an already\nmature research endeavour for photos, there is no research on the efficient\ninference specifically designed for sketch data. In this paper, we first\ndemonstrate existing state-of-the-art efficient light-weight models designed\nfor photos do not work on sketches. We then propose two sketch-specific\ncomponents which work in a plug-n-play manner on any photo efficient network to\nadapt them to work on sketch data. We specifically chose fine-grained\nsketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR) as a demonstrator as the most recognised\nsketch problem with immediate commercial value. Technically speaking, we first\npropose a cross-modal knowledge distillation network to transfer existing photo\nefficient networks to be compatible with sketch, which brings down number of\nFLOPs and model parameters by 97.96% percent and 84.89% respectively. We then\nexploit the abstract trait of sketch to introduce a RL-based canvas selector\nthat dynamically adjusts to the abstraction level which further cuts down\nnumber of FLOPs by two thirds. The end result is an overall reduction of 99.37%\nof FLOPs (from 40.18G to 0.254G) when compared with a full network, while\nretaining the accuracy (33.03% vs 32.77%) -- finally making an efficient\nnetwork for the sparse sketch data that exhibit even fewer FLOPs than the best\nphoto counterpart.",

    "content": "Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a standard technique for\naligning language models with human preferences in a supervised manner. Despite\nits empirical success, the theoretical justification behind its log-ratio\nreward parameterization remains incomplete. In this work, we address this gap\nby utilizing the Differential Information Distribution (DID): a distribution\nover token sequences that captures the information gained during policy\nupdates. First, we show that when preference labels encode the differential\ninformation required to transform a reference policy into a target policy, the\nlog-ratio reward in DPO emerges as the uniquely optimal form for learning the\ntarget policy via preference optimization. This result naturally yields a\nclosed-form expression for the optimal sampling distribution over rejected\nresponses. Second, we find that the condition for preferences to encode\ndifferential information is fundamentally linked to an implicit assumption\nregarding log-margin ordered policies-an inductive bias widely used in\npreference optimization yet previously unrecognized. Finally, by analyzing the\nentropy of the DID, we characterize how learning low-entropy differential\ninformation reinforces the policy distribution, while high-entropy differential\ninformation induces a smoothing effect, which explains the log-likelihood\ndisplacement phenomenon. We validate our theoretical findings in synthetic\nexperiments and extend them to real-world instruction-following datasets. Our\nresults suggest that learning high-entropy differential information is crucial\nfor general instruction-following, while learning low-entropy differential\ninformation benefits knowledge-intensive question answering. Overall, our work\npresents a unifying perspective on the DPO objective, the structure of\npreference data, and resulting policy behaviors through the lens of\ndifferential information.",

    "content": "Abstract: \n\n>Large Language Models (LLMs) trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) have exhibited strong reasoning capabilities and emergent reflective behaviors, such as backtracking and error correction. However, conven tional Markovian RL confines exploration to the training phase to learn an optimal deterministic policy and depends on the history contexts only through the current state. Therefore, it remains unclear whether reflec tive reasoning will emerge during Markovian RL training, or why they are beneficial at test time. To remedy this, we recast reflective exploration within the Bayes-Adaptive RL framework, which explicitly optimizes the expected return under a posterior distribution over Markov decision processes. This Bayesian formulation inherently incentivizes both reward-maximizing exploitation and information-gathering exploration via belief updates. Our resulting algorithm, BARL, instructs the LLM to stitch and switch strategies based on the observed outcomes, offering principled guidance on when and how the model should reflectively explore. Empirical results on both synthetic and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that BARL outperforms standard Markovian RL approaches at test time, achieving superior token efficiency with improved exploration effectiveness.\n\nA paper by Google adding reflecting on previous attempts when doing RL in LLMs. Might have interesting implications so wanted to share it here. \n\nPaper link: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20561](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20561)",

So, I experienced this, and it was really frustrating. So, I found that the main problem was that the AI, whether I'm using Claude Sonnet, 3.7 or 4, as well as Gemini 2.5 Pro models, just didn't have the recent context of the repo that I was working on. So that is why I created VisionCraft, which hosts over 100K+ code databases and knowledge bases. It's currently available as a standalone AI app and MCP server that you can plug directly into Cursor, Windsurf, and Claude Desktop with minimal token footprint.

    "content": "So I read Plato, Dialogues, again an I find one fascinating story (ancient legend) there: point is, the person who “invented” written language among many other modern things came to king of ancient Egypt of that times to demonstrate his inventions. But the kind was not happy, he said, by writing down knowledge into words, he took it out of heads of people and made it secondary, not real life experience. (Btw Socrates didn’t write a single text because of that in some sort, only Plato wrote after his words so classical philosophy exists at all)\n\nSo king said now people will depend on written knowledge and it can be fake and real wisdom will vanish form peoples heads. People will follow false knowledge… it was 3k years ago. Same problem we have now.\n\nWith the latest video generations and all the stuff that is coming with advanced AI I feel we are getting into that loop again!\n\nEverything you didn’t experience in real time life might be fake and used against you.\n\nI really don’t understand now how we will deal with that problem. Maybe we will have tech free spaces or something… Like if there is no way AI is used at certain schools or malls, so we can be sure there couldn’t be generated video content from that place.. I think new generations will adapt and figure that out.",
