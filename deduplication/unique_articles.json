    "content": "We introduce Genie Envisioner (GE), a unified world foundation platform for\nrobotic manipulation that integrates policy learning, evaluation, and\nsimulation within a single video-generative framework. At its core, GE-Base is\na large-scale, instruction-conditioned video diffusion model that captures the\nspatial, temporal, and semantic dynamics of real-world robotic interactions in\na structured latent space. Built upon this foundation, GE-Act maps latent\nrepresentations to executable action trajectories through a lightweight,\nflow-matching decoder, enabling precise and generalizable policy inference\nacross diverse embodiments with minimal supervision. To support scalable\nevaluation and training, GE-Sim serves as an action-conditioned neural\nsimulator, producing high-fidelity rollouts for closed-loop policy development.\nThe platform is further equipped with EWMBench, a standardized benchmark suite\nmeasuring visual fidelity, physical consistency, and instruction-action\nalignment. Together, these components establish Genie Envisioner as a scalable\nand practical foundation for instruction-driven, general-purpose embodied\nintelligence. All code, models, and benchmarks will be released publicly."

    "content": "Mobile robots navigating in crowds trained using reinforcement learning are\nknown to suffer performance degradation when faced with out-of-distribution\nscenarios. We propose that by properly accounting for the uncertainties of\npedestrians, a robot can learn safe navigation policies that are robust to\ndistribution shifts. Our method augments agent observations with prediction\nuncertainty estimates generated by adaptive conformal inference, and it uses\nthese estimates to guide the agent's behavior through constrained reinforcement\nlearning. The system helps regulate the agent's actions and enables it to adapt\nto distribution shifts. In the in-distribution setting, our approach achieves a\n96.93% success rate, which is over 8.80% higher than the previous\nstate-of-the-art baselines with over 3.72 times fewer collisions and 2.43 times\nfewer intrusions into ground-truth human future trajectories. In three\nout-of-distribution scenarios, our method shows much stronger robustness when\nfacing distribution shifts in velocity variations, policy changes, and\ntransitions from individual to group dynamics. We deploy our method on a real\nrobot, and experiments show that the robot makes safe and robust decisions when\ninteracting with both sparse and dense crowds.

    "content": "Live streaming platforms have become a dominant form of online content\nconsumption, offering dynamically evolving content, real-time interactions, and\nhighly engaging user experiences. These unique characteristics introduce new\nchallenges that differentiate live streaming recommendation from traditional\nrecommendation settings and have garnered increasing attention from industry in\nrecent years. However, research progress in academia has been hindered by the\nlack of publicly available datasets that accurately reflect the dynamic nature\nof live streaming environments. To address this gap, we introduce KuaiLive, the\nfirst real-time, interactive dataset collected from Kuaishou, a leading live\nstreaming platform in China with over 400 million daily active users. The\ndataset records the interaction logs of 23,772 users and 452,621 streamers over\na 21-day period. Compared to existing datasets, KuaiLive offers several\nadvantages: it includes precise live room start and end timestamps, multiple\ntypes of real-time user interactions (click, comment, like, gift), and rich\nside information features for both users and streamers. These features enable\nmore realistic simulation of dynamic candidate items and better modeling of\nuser and streamer behaviors. We conduct a thorough analysis of KuaiLive from\nmultiple perspectives and evaluate several representative recommendation\nmethods on it, establishing a strong benchmark for future research. KuaiLive\ncan support a wide range of tasks in the live streaming domain, such as top-K\nrecommendation, click-through rate prediction, watch time prediction, and gift\nprice prediction. Moreover, its fine-grained behavioral data also enables\nresearch on multi-behavior modeling, multi-task learning, and fairness-aware\nrecommendation. The dataset and related resources are publicly available at\nhttps://imgkkk574.github.io/KuaiLive."

    "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have started to demonstrate the ability to\npersuade humans, yet our understanding of how this dynamic transpires is\nlimited. Recent work has used linear probes, lightweight tools for analyzing\nmodel representations, to study various LLM skills such as the ability to model\nuser sentiment and political perspective. Motivated by this, we apply probes to\nstudy persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations. We leverage\ninsights from cognitive science to train probes on distinct aspects of\npersuasion: persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy.\nDespite their simplicity, we show that they capture various aspects of\npersuasion at both the sample and dataset levels. For instance, probes can\nidentify the point in a conversation where the persuadee was persuaded or where\npersuasive success generally occurs across the entire dataset. We also show\nthat in addition to being faster than expensive prompting-based approaches,\nprobes can do just as well and even outperform prompting in some settings, such\nas when uncovering persuasion strategy. This suggests probes as a plausible\navenue for studying other complex behaviours such as deception and\nmanipulation, especially in multi-turn settings and large-scale dataset\nanalysis where prompting-based methods would be computationally inefficient."

    "content": "Capturing human learning behavior based on deep learning methods has become a\nmajor research focus in both psychology and intelligent systems. Recent\napproaches rely on controlled experiments or rule-based models to explore\ncognitive processes. However, they struggle to capture learning dynamics, track\nprogress over time, or provide explainability. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework based on Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to simulate a realistic teaching environment. To explore\nhuman-like learning dynamics, we construct learners with psychologically\ngrounded profiles-such as Deep, Surface, and Lazy-as well as a persona-free\nGeneral Learner to inspect the base LLM's default behavior. Through weekly\nknowledge acquisition, monthly strategic choices, periodic tests, and peer\ninteraction, we can track the dynamic learning progress of individual learners\nover a full-year journey. Our findings are fourfold: 1) Longitudinal analysis\nreveals that only Deep Learner achieves sustained cognitive growth. Our\nspecially designed \"trap questions\" effectively diagnose Surface Learner's\nshallow knowledge. 2) The behavioral and cognitive patterns of distinct\nlearners align closely with their psychological profiles. 3) Learners'\nself-concept scores evolve realistically, with the General Learner developing\nsurprisingly high self-efficacy despite its cognitive limitations. 4)\nCritically, the default profile of base LLM is a \"diligent but brittle Surface\nLearner\"-an agent that mimics the behaviors of a good student but lacks true,\ngeneralizable understanding. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that\nLearnerAgent aligns well with real scenarios, yielding more insightful findings\nabout LLMs' behavior."

    "source_platform": "arXiv",
    "content": "This paper argues that Active Inference (AIF) provides a crucial foundation\nfor developing autonomous AI agents capable of learning from experience without\ncontinuous human reward engineering. As AI systems begin to exhaust\nhigh-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for\nreward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges\nthat could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The\nproposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated\ndata, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on\nextensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the\nbottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we\nidentify as the \\textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI\nsystems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to\nchanging circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing\nexternal reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy,\nallowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a\nunified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative\nworld models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create\nagents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with\nhuman values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that\ncan develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical\nconstraints."

    "content": "Trajectory prediction is a critical task in modeling human behavior,\nespecially in safety-critical domains such as social robotics and autonomous\nvehicle navigation. Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often\nlack accuracy and generalizability. Although deep learning approaches offer\nimproved performance, they typically suffer from high computational cost,\nlimited explainability, and, importantly, poor generalization to\nout-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a\nframework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design\ntrajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to\ngenerate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We propose\ntwo key innovations: Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to encourage population\ndiversity, and a Statistics Feedback Loop that enables the LLM to analyze and\nimprove alternative predictions. Our evaluations demonstrate that TrajEvo\noutperforms existing heuristic methods across multiple real-world datasets, and\nnotably surpasses both heuristic and deep learning methods in generalizing to\nan unseen OOD real-world dataset. TrajEvo marks a promising step toward the\nautomated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction\nheuristics.

    "content": "Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding, the task of mapping natural\nlanguage instructions to precise screen coordinates, is fundamental to\nautonomous GUI agents. While existing methods achieve strong performance\nthrough extensive supervised training or reinforcement learning with labeled\nrewards, they remain constrained by the cost and availability of pixel-level\nannotations. We observe that when models generate multiple predictions for the\nsame GUI element, the spatial overlap patterns reveal implicit confidence\nsignals that can guide more accurate localization. Leveraging this insight, we\npropose GUI-RC (Region Consistency), a test-time scaling method that constructs\nspatial voting grids from multiple sampled predictions to identify consensus\nregions where models show highest agreement. Without any training, GUI-RC\nimproves accuracy by 2-3% across various architectures on ScreenSpot\nbenchmarks. We further introduce GUI-RCPO (Region Consistency Policy\nOptimization), which transforms these consistency patterns into rewards for\ntest-time reinforcement learning. By computing how well each prediction aligns\nwith the collective consensus, GUI-RCPO enables models to iteratively refine\ntheir outputs on unlabeled data during inference. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the generality of our approach: GUI-RC boosts\nQwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct from 80.11% to 83.57% on ScreenSpot-v2, while GUI-RCPO\nfurther improves it to 85.14% through self-supervised optimization.

We present OmniEAR, a\ncomprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about\nphysical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied\ntasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit\ncollaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire\ncapabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task\ndemands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous\nphysical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios\nspanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals\nsevere performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while\nachieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to\n56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound\ntasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental\ninformation degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter\ntask-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically\n(0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing\nfundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied\nreasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can\naddress, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and\nadvancing embodied AI systems.

Six 3D-vision\nresearchers spent more than 300 hours meticulously crafting 1,000 challenging,\nunambiguous multiple-choice questions from over 120,000 images, each paired\nwith carefully designed distractors and a step-by-step reasoning process.

Despite an already\nmature research endeavour for photos, there is no research on the efficient\ninference specifically designed for sketch data. In this paper, we first\ndemonstrate existing state-of-the-art efficient light-weight models designed\nfor photos do not work on sketches. We then propose two sketch-specific\ncomponents which work in a plug-n-play manner on any photo efficient network to\nadapt them to work on sketch data. We specifically chose fine-grained\nsketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR) as a demonstrator as the most recognised\nsketch problem with immediate commercial value. Technically speaking, we first\npropose a cross-modal knowledge distillation network to transfer existing photo\nefficient networks to be compatible with sketch, which brings down number of\nFLOPs and model parameters by 97.96% percent and 84.89% respectively. We then\nexploit the abstract trait of sketch to introduce a RL-based canvas selector\nthat dynamically adjusts to the abstraction level which further cuts down\nnumber of FLOPs by two thirds. The end result is an overall reduction of 99.37%\nof FLOPs (from 40.18G to 0.254G) when compared with a full network, while\nretaining the accuracy (33.03% vs 32.77%) -- finally making an efficient\nnetwork for the sparse sketch data that exhibit even fewer FLOPs than the best\nphoto counterpart.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23761v1",
    "content": "Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a standard technique for\naligning language models with human preferences in a supervised manner. Despite\nits empirical success, the theoretical justification behind its log-ratio\nreward parameterization remains incomplete. In this work, we address this gap\nby utilizing the Differential Information Distribution (DID): a distribution\nover token sequences that captures the information gained during policy\nupdates. First, we show that when preference labels encode the differential\ninformation required to transform a reference policy into a target policy, the\nlog-ratio reward in DPO emerges as the uniquely optimal form for learning the\ntarget policy via preference optimization. This result naturally yields a\nclosed-form expression for the optimal sampling distribution over rejected\nresponses. Second, we find that the condition for preferences to encode\ndifferential information is fundamentally linked to an implicit assumption\nregarding log-margin ordered policies-an inductive bias widely used in\npreference optimization yet previously unrecognized. Finally, by analyzing the\nentropy of the DID, we characterize how learning low-entropy differential\ninformation reinforces the policy distribution, while high-entropy differential\ninformation induces a smoothing effect, which explains the log-likelihood\ndisplacement phenomenon. We validate our theoretical findings in synthetic\nexperiments and extend them to real-world instruction-following datasets. Our\nresults suggest that learning high-entropy differential information is crucial\nfor general instruction-following, while learning low-entropy differential\ninformation benefits knowledge-intensive question answering. Overall, our work\npresents a unifying perspective on the DPO objective, the structure of\npreference data, and resulting policy behaviors through the lens of\ndifferential information.",

Therefore, it remains unclear whether reflec tive reasoning will emerge during Markovian RL training, or why they are beneficial at test time. To remedy this, we recast reflective exploration within the Bayes-Adaptive RL framework, which explicitly optimizes the expected return under a posterior distribution over Markov decision processes. This Bayesian formulation inherently incentivizes both reward-maximizing exploitation and information-gathering exploration via belief updates. Our resulting algorithm, BARL, instructs the LLM to stitch and switch strategies based on the observed outcomes, offering principled guidance on when and how the model should reflectively explore. Empirical results on both synthetic and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that BARL outperforms standard Markovian RL approaches at test time, achieving superior token efficiency with improved exploration effectiveness.\n\nA paper by Google adding reflecting on previous attempts when doing RL in LLMs. Might have interesting implications so wanted to share it here. \n\nPaper link: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20561](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20561)",

So, I experienced this, and it was really frustrating. So, I found that the main problem was that the AI, whether I'm using Claude Sonnet, 3.7 or 4, as well as Gemini 2.5 Pro models, just didn't have the recent context of the repo that I was working on. So that is why I created VisionCraft, which hosts over 100K+ code databases and knowledge bases. It's currently available as a standalone AI app and MCP server that you can plug directly into Cursor, Windsurf, and Claude Desktop with minimal token footprint. Currently, it is better than Context7, based on our early beta testers.\n\n\n\n[https://github.com/augmentedstartups/VisionCraft-MCP-Server](https://github.com/augmentedstartups/VisionCraft-MCP-Server)",

But the kind was not happy, he said, by writing down knowledge into words, he took it out of heads of people and made it secondary, not real life experience. (Btw Socrates didn’t write a single text because of that in some sort, only Plato wrote after his words so classical philosophy exists at all)\n\nSo king said now people will depend on written knowledge and it can be fake and real wisdom will vanish form peoples heads. People will follow false knowledge… it was 3k years ago. Same problem we have now.\n\nWith the latest video generations and all the stuff that is coming with advanced AI I feel we are getting into that loop again!\n\nEverything you didn’t experience in real time life might be fake and used against you.\n\nI really don’t understand now how we will deal with that problem. Maybe we will have tech free spaces or something… Like if there is no way AI is used at certain schools or malls, so we can be sure there couldn’t be generated video content from that place.. I think new generations will adapt and figure that out.",

Our approach employs object-centric grounding as visual chain-of-thought signals, enabling more effective goal-conditioned visual attention during multimodal reasoning tasks. Evaluations on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Argus excels in both multimodal reasoning tasks and referring object grounding tasks. Extensive analysis further validates various design choices of Argus, and reveals the effectiveness of explicit language-guided visual region-of-interest engagement in MLLMs, highlighting the importance of advancing multimodal intelligence from a visual-centric perspective.

In this paper, we introduce Aggregative Question Answering, a novel task requiring models to reason explicitly over thousands of user-chatbot interactions to answer aggregative queries, such as identifying emerging concerns among specific demographics. To enable research in this direction, we construct a benchmark, WildChat-AQA, comprising 6,027 aggregative questions derived from 182,330 real-world chatbot conversations. Experiments show that existing methods either struggle to reason effectively or incur prohibitive computational costs, underscoring the need for new approaches capable of extracting collective insights from large-scale conversational data.",

Existing benchmarks, however, probe only single-image relations and thus fail to assess the multi-image spatial reasoning that real-world deployments demand. We introduce MMSI-Bench, a VQA benchmark dedicated to multi-image spatial intelligence. Six 3D-vision researchers spent more than 300 hours meticulously crafting 1,000 challenging, unambiguous multiple-choice questions from over 120,000 images, each paired with carefully designed distractors and a step-by-step reasoning process. We conduct extensive experiments and thoroughly evaluate 34 open-source and proprietary MLLMs, observing a wide gap: the strongest open-source model attains roughly 30% accuracy and OpenAI's o3 reasoning model reaches 40%, while humans score 97%. These results underscore the challenging nature of MMSI-Bench and the substantial headroom for future research. Leveraging the annotated reasoning processes, we also provide an automated error analysis pipeline that diagnoses four dominant failure modes, including (1) grounding errors, (2) overlap-matching and scene-reconstruction errors, (3) situation-transformation reasoning errors, and (4) spatial-logic errors, offering valuable insights for advancing multi-image spatial intelligence.

    "content": "The rapid advancement of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has propelled the development of pure-vision-based GUI Agents, capable of perceiving and operating Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) to autonomously fulfill user instructions. However, existing approaches usually adopt an offline learning framework, which faces two core limitations: (1) heavy reliance on high-quality manual annotations for element grounding and action supervision, and (2) limited adaptability to dynamic and interactive environments. To address these limitations, we propose ZeroGUI, a scalable, online learning framework for automating GUI Agent training at Zero human cost. Specifically, ZeroGUI integrates (i) VLM-based automatic task generation to produce diverse training goals from the current environment state, (ii) VLM-based automatic reward estimation to assess task success without hand-crafted evaluation functions, and (iii) two-stage online reinforcement learning to continuously interact with and learn from GUI environments. Experiments on two advanced GUI Agents (UI-TARS and Aguvis) demonstrate that ZeroGUI significantly boosts performance across OSWorld and AndroidLab environments.

    "content": "As sketch research has collectively matured over time, its adaptation for at-mass commercialisation emerges on the immediate horizon. Despite an already mature research endeavour for photos, there is no research on the efficient inference specifically designed for sketch data. In this paper, we first demonstrate existing state-of-the-art efficient light-weight models designed for photos do not work on sketches. We then propose two sketch-specific components which work in a plug-n-play manner on any photo efficient network to adapt them to work on sketch data. We specifically chose fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR) as a demonstrator as the most recognised sketch problem with immediate commercial value. Technically speaking, we first propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation network to transfer existing photo efficient networks to be compatible with sketch, which brings down number of FLOPs and model parameters by 97.96% percent and 84.89% respectively. We then exploit the abstract trait of sketch to introduce a RL-based canvas selector that dynamically adjusts to the abstraction level which further cuts down number of FLOPs by two thirds. The end result is an overall reduction of 99.37% of FLOPs (from 40.18G to 0.254G) when compared with a full network, while retaining the accuracy (33.03% vs 32.77%) -- finally making an efficient network for the sparse sketch data that exhibit even fewer FLOPs than the best photo counterpart.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23761v1",
    "content": "Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a standard technique for aligning language models with human preferences in a supervised manner. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical justification behind its log-ratio reward parameterization remains incomplete. In this work, we address this gap by utilizing the Differential Information Distribution (DID): a distribution over token sequences that captures the information gained during policy updates. First, we show that when preference labels encode the differential information required to transform a reference policy into a target policy, the log-ratio reward in DPO emerges as the uniquely optimal form for learning the target policy via preference optimization. This result naturally yields a closed-form expression for the optimal sampling distribution over rejected responses. Second, we find that the condition for preferences to encode differential information is fundamentally linked to an implicit assumption regarding log-margin ordered policies-an inductive bias widely used in preference optimization yet previously unrecognized. Finally, by analyzing the entropy of the DID, we characterize how learning low-entropy differential information reinforces the policy distribution, while high-entropy differential information induces a smoothing effect, which explains the log-likelihood displacement phenomenon. We validate our theoretical findings in synthetic experiments and extend them to real-world instruction-following datasets. Our results suggest that learning high-entropy differential information is crucial for general instruction-following, while learning low-entropy differential information benefits knowledge-intensive question answering. Overall, our work presents a unifying perspective on the DPO objective, the structure of preference data, and resulting policy behaviors through the lens of differential information.",

In this work, we propose a framework, based on the condition number of a Hessian matrix, to analyze model immunization for linear models. Building on this framework, we design an algorithm with regularization terms to control the resulting condition numbers after pre-training. Empirical results on linear models and non-linear deep-nets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on model immunization.

In this paper, we investigate the capacity of contemporary VLMs to interpret and solve rebus puzzles by constructing a hand-generated and annotated benchmark of diverse English-language rebus puzzles, ranging from simple pictographic substitutions to spatially-dependent cues (\"head\" over \"heels\"). We analyze how different VLMs perform, and our findings reveal that while VLMs exhibit some surprising capabilities in decoding simple visual clues, they struggle significantly with tasks requiring abstract reasoning, lateral thinking, and understanding visual metaphors.",

    "content": "Abstract: >Large Language Models (LLMs) trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) have exhibited strong reasoning capabilities and emergent reflective behaviors, such as backtracking and error correction. However, conven tional Markovian RL confines exploration to the training phase to learn an optimal deterministic policy and depends on the history contexts only through the current state. Therefore, it remains unclear whether reflec tive reasoning will emerge during Markovian RL training, or why they are beneficial at test time. To remedy this, we recast reflective exploration within the Bayes-Adaptive RL framework, which explicitly optimizes the expected return under a posterior distribution over Markov decision processes. This Bayesian formulation inherently incentivizes both reward-maximizing exploitation and information-gathering exploration via belief updates. Our resulting algorithm, BARL, instructs the LLM to stitch and switch strategies based on the observed outcomes, offering principled guidance on when and how the model should reflectively explore. Empirical results on both synthetic and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that BARL outperforms standard Markovian RL approaches at test time, achieving superior token efficiency with improved exploration effectiveness. A paper by Google adding reflecting on previous attempts when doing RL in LLMs. Might have interesting implications so wanted to share it here.

So, I experienced this, and it was really frustrating. So, I found that the main problem was that the AI, whether I'm using Claude Sonnet, 3.7 or 4, as well as Gemini 2.5 Pro models, just didn't have the recent context of the repo that I was working on. So that is why I created VisionCraft, which hosts over 100K+ code databases and knowledge bases. It's currently available as a standalone AI app and MCP server that you can plug directly into Cursor, Windsurf, and Claude Desktop with minimal token footprint. Currently, it is better than Context7, based on our early beta testers. [https://github.com/augmentedstartups/VisionCraft-MCP-Server](https://github.com/augmentedstartups/VisionCraft-MCP-Server)",
